# plan372-blocked-train-crossings
This is the analysis for my PLAN372: Urban Data Analytics final at UNC Chapel Hill.

I analayzed pedestrian risk at blocked train crossings in the United States. I used government data from the FRA and EPA. I ran a multivariable regression and constructed risk scores to identify the highest risk crossings.
